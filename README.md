# Coffee Shop Website ☕️

This is a simple and responsive coffee shop website built using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS 4. The purpose of this project was to practice core React concepts like routing with React Router DOM, managing state using useState, and handling side effects using useEffect. I also integrated the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library to add smooth scroll-based animations. The website includes five main pages: Home, About, Menu, Blog, and Contact. Each section is styled using TailwindCSS and designed to be clean and mobile-friendly. This project helped me improve my understanding of React component structure, navigation, and animation effects.
